GSAP Introductory Project
Welcome to the GSAP Introductory Project repository! This project is designed to help you get started with the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP), a powerful JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations.

Project Overview
This project demonstrates the basics of GSAP, including how to create simple animations, control their timing and sequence, and apply various effects to HTML elements. You'll find examples of animating properties such as position, opacity, and rotation, as well as how to use GSAP's timeline feature to coordinate multiple animations.

Features
Basic Animations: Learn how to animate HTML elements using GSAP's gsap.to and gsap.from methods.
Advanced Animations: Explore more complex animations involving multiple properties and easing functions.
Timelines: Understand how to create and control sequences of animations using gsap.timeline.
Responsive Design: Ensure your animations work smoothly across different screen sizes and devices.
